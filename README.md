# tails gets trolled: the game
some dumb "game" i made in visual studio 2005

to compile, you'll need a working copy of visual studio (i'm not 100% sure if newer version will open this, but you can try and tell me if it does)
then just open it and click build solution, you'll have an exe in the bin folder of your project. pre-compiled binaries are in the bin folder of this project if you're lazy.
