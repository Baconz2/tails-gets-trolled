# tails gets trolled: the game
some dumb "game" i made in visual studio 2005


### why did you make this
basically to learn how to use visual basic, visual studio and .net


### why not just use visual studio 2019 lol
i use linux, and it doesn't exactly work well in wine

and running windows 10 in a vm is like a death sentence for my pc, and since vs2005 works in xp, i used that



# to compile, or to not compile
to compile, you'll need a working copy of visual studio (i'm not 100% sure if newer versions will open this, but you can try and tell me if it does)

git clone the project, then open the .sln and click build>build solution, you'll have an exe in the bin folder. pre-compiled binaries are in the bin folder.
