# tails gets trolled: the game
some dumb "game" i made in visual studio 2005


### why did you make this
basically to learn how to use visual basic, visual studio and .net


### why not just use visual studio 2019 lol
i use linux, and it doesn't exactly work in wine (see [this](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=38520))

and running windows 10 in a vm is like a death sentence for my pc, and since vs2005 works in xp, i used that



# to compile, or to not compile
to compile, you'll need a working copy of visual studio (i asked someone and they said it worked in vs2019, so it *should* work in most versions maybe)

git clone the project, then open the .sln and click build>build solution, you'll have an exe in the bin folder. pre-compiled binaries are in the bin folder.

(for the time being maybe) if you're planning to make pull requests, please make edits in vs2005, otherwise i won't be able to do anything with it
