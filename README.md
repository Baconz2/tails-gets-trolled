# tails gets trolled: the game
some dumb "game" i made in visual studio 2005

to compile, you'll need a working copy of visual studio (i'm not 100% sure if newer version will open this, but you can try and tell me if it does)

git clone the project, then open the .sln and click build>build solution, you'll have an exe in the bin folder. pre-compiled binaries are in the bin folder of this project if you're lazy/don't have vs.
