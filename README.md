# tails gets trolled: the game
some dumb "game" i made in visual studio 2005


### why did you make this
basically to learn how to use visual basic, visual studio and .net


# to compile, or to not compile
to compile, you'll need a working copy of visual studio (i tried it in vs2019 and it ran worse than if compiled in vs2005 but it works)

git clone the project, then open the .sln and click build>build solution, you'll have an exe in the bin folder. pre-compiled binaries are in the bin folder.

if you're planning to make pull requests, please make edits in vs2005, otherwise i won't be able to do anything with it
