# tails gets trolled: the game
some dumb "game" i made in visual studio 2005


### why did you make this
basically to learn how to use visual basic, visual studio and .net


# to compile, or to not compile
to compile, you'll need a working copy of visual studio

git clone the project, then open the .sln and click build>build solution, you'll have an exe in the bin folder. pre-compiled binaries are in the bin folder and under releases.
